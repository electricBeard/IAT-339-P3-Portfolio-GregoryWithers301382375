                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            The Pavilion was the final project for the course 233: Spatial Design, in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. This structure was intended to serve as a gathering site for ceremonies and/or lectures, holding a maximum of 40 guests.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            As a cerimonial space, ensuring a positive, aesthetically pleasing experience of observers and presenters was the main challenge of this project. My decision to do position the front entryway and rear patio ensures this because XYZ. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>My Role</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            I worked with a team of 3 other designers. Together, we collaborated on the priciples of circulation, functionality, and aesthetics. I was responsible for encouraging communication, producing sketches, and 3D modelling using Rhino and Twinmotion. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            My role -> responsibilities, improvements to be made in team interaction/execution. Give credit where it is due.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="flow-row">
                    <div class="left">
                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Time was the main limiting factor in this project. It was slated to last 3 weeks from initial brief to completion. The busy end-of-term push to finish projects accross many classes compounded this constraint. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Human resources were also strained, as team members had to juggle responsibilites between multiple end-of-term projects.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Scope was perhaps the simplest constraint on this project. The project brief gave me a clear idea of the size, shape, textures, and landscape requirements for the building. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Excellent planning and use of resources allowed for extra time to be spent developing a reflecting pool around the Pavilion. This added detail garnered praise from the teaching team and peers.
