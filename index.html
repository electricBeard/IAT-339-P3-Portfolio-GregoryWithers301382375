                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            The Pavilion was the final project for the course 233: Spatial Design, in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. This structure was intended to serve as a gathering site for ceremonies and/or lectures, holding a maximum of 40 guests.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            Ensuring a positive, aesthetically pleasing experience for observers and presenters was the main challenge of this project. My decision to position the front entryway and rear patio in-line accomplishes this because visitors can easily view the stage, the stage is framed in light from the large rear window, and visitor movement flows can easily move in and out of the building through the front and rear exits. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>My Role</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            I worked with a team of 3 other designers. Together, we collaborated on the priciples of circulation, functionality, and aesthetics. I was responsible for encouraging communication, maintaining the group schedule, producing sketches, and 3D modelling using Rhino and Twinmotion.

                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Time was the main limiting factor in this project. It was slated to last 3 weeks from initial brief to completion. The busy end-of-term push to finish projects accross many classes compounded this constraint. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Human resources were also strained, as team members had to juggle responsibilites between multiple end-of-term projects.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Scope was perhaps the simplest constraint on this project. The project brief gave me a clear idea of the size, shape, textures, and landscape requirements for the building. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Excellent planning and use of resources allowed for extra time to be spent developing a reflecting pool and environmental details around the Pavilion. These added details garnered praise from the teaching team and peers.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            The main challenge I encountered was to design a datum, a form that anchors all the elements of the design. We performed a site visit to to Holland Park, the purposed location of the structure ... made drawings ... etc. ... I initiated the center entrance/exit, later expanded it to include a walkway through the reflecting pool.

                            Another challenge I overcame was enabling customizable textures. Initially, the model would feature a single texture on all surfaces. To solve this, I separated every surface onto a unique layer within Rhino. Notice the image where I selected every window and moved it to the same layer, coloured blue - this allowed them all to be textured as glass later on, while retaining wood, metal, and stone textures elsewhere.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            The Polygon Gallery in North Vancouver (link to their site) participated with my project team for the course 333: Interaction Design, in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="my-1">
                            The main goal of the course was to to solve a problem for the Gallery. Through various design processes, interviews, and observations we identified the main problem to be the negative interaction that occurs between visitors and guest services workers. Because the Gallery does not align with a general conception of an art gallery, visitors are not aware they must check-in at the front desk and leave food/drink/bags downstairs.
                        </p>

                        <h4>My Role</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            I worked with a team of 4 other designers. Together, we collaborated with representatives from The Polygon.

                            I was responsible for team management and concept oversight. I encouraged communication between team members, led design meetings, distributed tasks, managed the work schedule, prepared presentations, conducted interviews, compiled/synthesized ethnographic data, sketched ideas, and performed graphic design.

                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Scope was the most challenging limitation of this project. Coordinating between design team members, the teaching staff, and the Polygon representatives eventually led to a manageable focus area.
                             
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Human resources were also strained, as team members had to juggle responsibilites between multiple end-of-term projects, work commitments, and extra-curricular activities. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Time remained a constant limitation throughout the project, however my decision to limit the length of meetings helped to focus group activities on the design topics at hand. Consistent bi-weekly meeting scheduling also contributed to an efficient process through the course objectives and production of course deliverables. The busy end-of-term push to finish projects accross many classes compounded this constraint.

                            The main challenge encountered was the group dynamic. With many passionate designers eager to share their opinions and debate concepts, our meetings were running overtime. Emotions were getting heated and the group morale was not ideal.  
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            I addressed this issue by leading several conflict managment meetings. I encouraged team members to share their feelings and sought to mediate differences of opinion. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            I consulted with the teaching team in search of feedback. This supported my position to encourage the team to express their opinions in an open dialogue, and settle disagreements over concept focus.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            Several boundaries/ground rules were established: Meetings were not to exceed 2 hours, helping us focus on the immediate tasks at hand. Design decisions would be decided by popular vote, and solid definitions of team member roles were established.
