    Validation Note:
    The background CSS function used to create an underline animation on in-text links reports as an error with W3C CSS Validation Service, however I found a post saying this is due to some sort of error in the validator itself due to the use of variables. It is slated to be updated. Please ignore that error message. All other errors have been rectified. 

    Please see this link for more details if needed: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/5349

    Site has also been tested on Firefox and Edge and functions as intended.

                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            The Pavilion was the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/group5iat233d101pavilion/home/" target="_blank"> final project</a> for the course 233: Spatial Design, in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. This structure was designed to serve as a gathering site for ceremonies and/or lectures, holding a maximum of 40 guests. It was intended to be constructed in Holland Park, Surrey BC. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            Ensuring a positive, aesthetically pleasing experience for observers and presenters was the main challenge of this project. My decision to position the front entryway and rear patio in-line accomplishes this because visitors can easily view the stage, the stage is framed in light from the large rear window, and visitor movement flows can easily move in and out of the building through the front and rear exits. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>My Role</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            I worked with a team of 3 other designers. Together, we collaborated on the priciples of circulation, functionality, and aesthetics. I was responsible for encouraging communication, maintaining the group schedule, producing sketches, and 3D modelling using Rhino and Twinmotion.

                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Time was the main limiting factor in this project. It was slated to last 3 weeks from initial brief to completion. The busy end-of-term push to finish projects accross many classes compounded this constraint. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Human resources were also strained, as team members had to juggle responsibilites between multiple end-of-term projects.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Scope was perhaps the simplest constraint on this project. The project brief gave me a clear idea of the size, shape, textures, and landscape requirements for the building. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Excellent planning and use of resources allowed for extra time to be spent developing a reflecting pool and environmental details around the Pavilion. These added details garnered praise from the teaching team and peers.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            The main challenge I encountered was to design a datum, a form that anchors all the elements of the design.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            To do this, our team performed a site visit to to Holland Park. I sketched various layouts and took in the environment. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            I initiated the center entrance/exit to accomodate the surrounding landscape and existing park pathways. Later, this was expanded it to include a walkway through the reflecting pool.

                            Another challenge I overcame was enabling customizable textures. One of the main project requirements was to use panel styling to mimic de stijl architecture and modern infill type construction practices. Unfortunately, the model would only feature a single texture on all surfaces, which is not condusive to these styles. 
                        </p>
                            
                        <p class="my-1">
                            To solve this, I separated every surface onto a unique layer within Rhino. Notice the image where I selected every window and moved it to the same layer, coloured blue - this allowed them all to be textured as glass later on, while retaining wood, metal, and stone textures elsewhere.

                            The project was successful, earning top marks of 90% and praise from the teaching team. Our peers were impressed by the level of detail we were able to achieve.  
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            My ability to focus on minute technical details, adapt to new systems, and visualize movement flows have all improved. Learning to communicate clearly and thoughtfully with teammates helped me to implement our shared design goals in a practical way.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            In the future I will seek to learn more about new programs/platforms ahead of time - perhaps by taking tutorial courses online - so less collaborative time is used debugging issues. In-person session time is an asset that I will strive to harness for the next project!

                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            <a href="https://thepolygon.ca/" target="_blank">The Polygon Gallery</a> in North Vancouver participated with my project team for the course 333: Interaction Design, in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="my-1">
                            The main goal of the course was to to solve a problem for the Gallery. Through various design processes, interviews, and observations we identified the main problem to be the negative interaction that occurs between visitors and guest services workers. Because the Gallery does not align with a general conception of an art gallery, visitors are not aware they must check-in at the front desk and leave food/drink/bags downstairs.
                        </p>

                            I worked with a team of 4 other designers. Together, we collaborated with representatives from The Polygon.

                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Scope was the most challenging limitation of this project. Coordinating between design team members, the teaching staff, and the Polygon representatives eventually led to a manageable focus area.
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Human resources were also strained, as team members had to juggle responsibilites between multiple end-of-term projects, work commitments, and extra-curricular activities. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="my-1">
                            Time remained a constant limitation throughout the project, however my decision to limit the length of meetings helped to focus group activities on the design topics at hand. Consistent bi-weekly meeting scheduling also contributed to an efficient process through the course objectives and production of course deliverables. The busy end-of-term push to finish projects accross many classes compounded this constraint.

                            The main challenge encountered was the group dynamic. With many passionate designers eager to share their opinions and debate concepts, our meetings were running overtime. Emotions were getting heated and the group morale was not ideal.  
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            I addressed this issue by leading several conflict managment meetings. I encouraged team members to share their feelings and sought to mediate differences of opinion. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            I consulted with the teaching team in search of feedback. This supported my position to encourage the team to express their opinions in an open dialogue, and settle disagreements over concept focus.
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            Several boundaries/ground rules were established: Meetings were not to exceed 2 hours, helping us focus on the immediate tasks at hand. Design decisions would be decided by popular vote, and solid definitions of team member roles were established.

                            I have put extraordinary effort into this course and this team. The Reframing Presentation benefitted from my ability to organize the team, synthesize contrasting opinions, settle disputes, and lead team analysis workshops. I was able to persuade team members to align with a new framing concept - ultimately leading to a strong presentation scoring 9/10.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            The 2 Concepts reframing process benefitted from my leadership by recalibrating our focus after our  ill-fated  Participatory Workshop Presentation. I led the team through ideation sessions, designing the beginning of our 2 Concepts Presentation to summarize our progress for them. I believe focusing on the visual conveyance of Polygon Gallery knowledge and visitor flow was key to a strong presentation - one that garnered a high level of feedback from our peers.

                        <p class="my-1">
                            My ability to reframe design concepts based on critique has improved. Learning to keep my emotions in check, not to argue, and take in contrasting opinions has benefitted the quality of our journey frameworks, which helped me to narrow the focus of our design interaction to the conflict between visitors and Polygon staff. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            In the future, I will proactively guide conversations and seek critique in these ways sooner rather than later. 
                         </p>

                        <p class="my-1">
                            Overall, the project was successful. Our final concept proved to be strikingly simple - a ticketing station. We were praised for honing our research and design processes to arrive at such an elegant solution.
